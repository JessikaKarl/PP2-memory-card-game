This wireframe was how the project was supost to look like. When I made the wireframe, I didn't think about how it would be possible to carry out the project. It was a nice design for a memory card game but with the skills and time I had I had to make compromises.
## Features
The features that will be implemented to the game with JavaScript is: 
- Flipping cards
- Shuffel cards
- Match cards correctly
- Timer for the game
- Counting moves for the game
- Pop up with rules/ information how to play the game

- The code has been testet with a html and css validator and is correct, no error.
- The project is unfortunately not finished therefore it has not been tested more than validator and how the cards are flipping side. 
### Unfixted Bugs 
- The cards are turned to the wrong side. The back should be facing up on the screen and the front with the diffrent christmas images should be facing down, and flipped up when clicked.
