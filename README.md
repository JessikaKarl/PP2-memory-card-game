# Portfolio Project 2 - JavaScript 
## Memory card game 
![]()
Project 2 is a Christmas memory card game, perfect for the holidays to get you in the christmas spirit. 
## Design 
### Colours 
The colours used is a neutral beige, black and a yellow colour for contrast. Because the images on the cards has a lot of colours it needed some simple colours to make it look good. 
The beige as a background on the cards to not take focus from the images and black for the text. 
### Typography 
The font that I used is Times. A simple and beautiful font that is easy to read. 
### Wireframes

This wireframe was how the project was supost to look like. When I made the wireframe, I didn't think about how it would be possible to carry out the project. It was a nice design for a memory card game but with the skills and time I had I needed to make compromises.
## Features
The features that will be implemented to the game with JavaScript is: 
- Flipping cards
- Shuffel cards
- Match cards correctly
- Timer for the game
- Counting moves for the game
- Pop up with rules/ information how to play the game 
## Testing
### Validator Testing 
![Html validator](https://github.com/JessikaKarl/PP2-memory-card-game/assets/147527640/2a8b9464-9528-47a7-b6e7-ca059c27e81a
)
![CSS validator](https://github.com/JessikaKarl/PP2-memory-card-game/assets/147527640/c05666d6-ca96-4c51-b0e6-de7b50f6bea3
)
- The code has been testet with a html and css validator and is correct, no error.
- The project is unfortunately not finished therefore it has not been tested more than validator and how the cards are flipping side. 
### Unfixted Bugs 
- The cards are turned to the wrong side. The back should be facing up on the screen and the front with the diffrent christmas images should be facing down, and flipped up when clicked. 
## Deployment 
The website is deployed to GitHub pages. This is how I deployed:

- Go to GitHub repository and click on the setting tab.
- To the left side there is a menu. Click on pages.
- Go to the heading called Branch. Select branch to main and select folder to root. When done click Save.
- Now the website is deployed.
